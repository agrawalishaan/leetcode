kadane's - kadane's is very specifically a 'sliding window' technique where we iterate over an iterable and maintain a dp. If the dp doesn't meet some condition, we reset it in a way, effectively "moving" what would be our left pointer. Kadane's movement follows an inchworm, because when we don't meet a condition we reset the dp to some defined place.

sliding window variable - these are more flexible, in that that the left pointer moves over by some other amount, depending on the problem. For instance finding the minimum size subarray that equals a certain sum (problem 209) consider [1, 3, 5] and our target is at least 6, once we hit [1,3,5] we keep decrementing from the left until we cannot any more. in sliding window we keep expanding until a condition is met (subarry has >= k sum) or broken (we have a repeating character), and then we shrink as much as needed (subarray too small) or (repeating character is gone)

two pointers - initialize two pointers that will be used to track or update things. Often, these are initialized at the left and right of the iterable, and move inwards, but this is not always the case, for instance: 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array, initializes two pointers at the beginning, one to read and one to update. Two pointers is distinct from sliding window because we aren't considering all the values in the window, rather just the pointers. It is also different from binary since that is a more specific subset of two pointers.

prefix / postfixes - similar to kadane's, but the difference is we aren't resetting anything, we're just establishing cumulative prefixes and postfixes
