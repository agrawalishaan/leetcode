learning purposes = review a concept or walkthrough a problems
difficulty = leetcode problem difficulty
modfications = slightly different ways to think about or implement a solution
helper = shows if this problem helps explain another problem, or uses a helper problem

tags:
arrays (sometimes used when we don't put a problem in the array category but it still has a lot of array/hashing work)
backtracking
beats 100%
bfs
binary search
binary tree
bit manipulation
bottom up recursion
bst [binary search tree]
bubble sort
bucket sort
circular
deque
dfs
dynamic programming 1d
greedy - not really used for problems that aren't explicitly tagged greedy, since lots of problems use greedy methods but the focus is on another part of the problem
heap
inorder traversal
insertion sort
kadane's
math
monotonic deque
monotonic queue
monotonic stack
multibranch (recursive or iterative)
