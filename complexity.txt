In 51, n queens, even if our result is multiple n^2 grids, our space complexity is still n^2, because when the result is finished, but not all states have been searched, we may still have n^2 extra memory allocated. So even if the result dominates the n^2 allocation, there is still n^2 auxillary memory.


sieve for primes: n log (log n) time


generally we can allocate around 20,000,000 things on leetcode, and based on test cases, 1,000,000 iterations
