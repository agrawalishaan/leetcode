two pointers - initialize two pointers that will be used to track or update things. Often, these are initialized at the left and right of the iterable, and move inwards, but this is not always the case, for instance: 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array, initializes two pointers at the beginning, one to read and one to update. Two pointers is distinct from sliding window because we aren't considering all the values in the window, rather just the pointers. It is also different from binary since that is a more specific subset of two pointers. In general, two pointer problems will have have a forced increment at the beginning, and it is up to us to determine what to increment and when inside the loop. This is not always the case though, such as in the simple code for 283: Move Zeroes, where we start with two pointers from the beginning.
