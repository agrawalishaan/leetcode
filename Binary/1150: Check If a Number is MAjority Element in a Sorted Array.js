/*
Simplified:
Input: nums = [2,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6], target = 5
Output: true
Explanation: The value 5 appears 5 times and the length of the array is 9.
Thus, 5 is a majority element because 5 > 9/2 is true.


Detailed:
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer target, return true if target is a majority element, or false otherwise.

A majority element in an array nums is an element that appears more than nums.length / 2 times in the array.
